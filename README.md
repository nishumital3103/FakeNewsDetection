# FakeNewsDetection

Face recognition attendance system using Python combines AI and image processing to automate attendance tracking.
This project implements a Fake News Detection System using machine learning. The objective is to classify news articles as real or fake based on their content, aiding in combating misinformation. The model is trained on labeled news datasets and uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques for feature extraction and classification.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and processes news text, including tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal.
Feature Extraction: Converts textual data into numerical formats using techniques like TF-IDF or Count Vectorization.
Machine Learning Models: Trains and evaluates models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Random Forest for classification.
Evaluation Metrics: Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
Prediction API: Provides a script or interface to classify new news articles.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Processing: pandas, numpy
NLP: nltk, scikit-learn
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
